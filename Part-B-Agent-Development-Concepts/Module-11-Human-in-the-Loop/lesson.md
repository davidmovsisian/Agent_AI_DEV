# Module 11: Human-in-the-Loop

## Overview

Design safe, controllable agents with human oversight. Learn to implement approval workflows, guardrails, and safety mechanisms.

**Duration**: 2-3 hours

## Learning Objectives

- Implement human approval workflows
- Add safety guardrails
- Design staged execution systems
- Build monitoring and alerting

## Key Concepts

### Human Approval Patterns
- Pre-approval (before action)
- Post-approval (review after)
- Selective approval (only critical actions)

### Guardrails
- Input validation
- Output filtering
- Action constraints
- Safety checks

### Staged Execution
- Dry-run mode
- Confirmation prompts
- Rollback capabilities

## Code Examples

- `human_approval_flow.py` - Approval implementation
- `guardrails.py` - Safety constraints
- `staged_execution.py` - Multi-stage execution
- `safety_checks.py` - Validation and filtering

## Exercises

- Add approval to agent
- Implement content filtering
- Build safety validator
- Create audit logging
