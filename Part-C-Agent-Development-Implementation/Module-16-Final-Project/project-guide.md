# Module 16: Final Project

## Overview

Design and build a complete multi-agent system that demonstrates all concepts learned throughout the course. This is your capstone project.

**Duration**: 10-15 hours

## Project Options

### Option 1: Customer Support System
Multi-agent ticket routing, resolution, and escalation system.

**Agents**:
- Classifier: Route tickets to specialists
- Resolver: Attempt automatic resolution
- Escalator: Escalate to humans when needed
- Learner: Improve from resolutions

### Option 2: Content Creation Pipeline
Research, writing, editing, and publishing workflow.

**Agents**:
- Researcher: Gather information
- Writer: Create content
- Editor: Review and refine
- Publisher: Format and publish

### Option 3: Code Review System
Collaborative code review with specialized agents.

**Agents**:
- Security Reviewer: Check for vulnerabilities
- Performance Analyzer: Optimize code
- Style Checker: Enforce standards
- Coordinator: Synthesize feedback

### Option 4: Research Assistant
Literature review and synthesis system.

**Agents**:
- Searcher: Find relevant papers
- Summarizer: Extract key points
- Synthesizer: Combine insights
- Reporter: Generate reports

### Option 5: Custom Project
Propose your own multi-agent system.
