# Module 15: Real-World Frameworks

## Overview

Master the most popular agent frameworks: LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, and AutoGen. Learn when to use each and how to implement the same agent across frameworks.

**Duration**: 8-10 hours

## Learning Objectives

- Build agents with LangChain
- Implement workflows with LangGraph
- Create teams with CrewAI
- Use AutoGen for conversations
- Compare frameworks and choose appropriately

## Frameworks

### LangChain (3 hours)
Most popular LLM framework
- Chains, agents, tools
- Memory management
- Integration ecosystem

### LangGraph (3 hours)
Graph-based workflows
- State machines
- Cyclic graphs
- Complex control flow

### CrewAI (2 hours)
Role-based multi-agent
- Agent roles and goals
- Task delegation
- Team collaboration

### AutoGen (2 hours)
Conversation framework
- Multi-agent chat
- Human-in-the-loop
- Group conversations

## Code Examples

Same agent in each framework:
- `langchain_agent.py`
- `langgraph_workflow.py`
- `crewai_example.py`
- `autogen_example.py`
- `framework_comparison.md`

## Exercises

- Port agents between frameworks
- Compare performance
- Choose optimal framework
